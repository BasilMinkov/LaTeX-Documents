abstract = {A method is described which can be used to extract common spatial patterns underlying the EEGs from two human populations. These spatial patterns account, in the least-squares sense, maximally for the variance in the EEGs from one population and minimally for the variance in the other population and therefore would seem to be optimal for quantitatively discriminating between the individual EEGs in the two populations. By using this method, it is suggested that the problems associated with the more common approach to discriminating EEGs, significance probability mapping, can be avoided. The method is tested using EEGs from a population of normal subjects and using the EEGs from a population of patients with neurologic disorders. The results in most cases are excellent and the misclassification which occurs in some cases is attributed to the nonhomogeneity of the patient population particularly. The advantages of the method for feature selection, for automatically classifying the clinical EEG, and with respect to the reference-free nature of the selected features are discussed.},

abstract = {The method of spatial power-spectrum analysis has been applied to measurements of the distribution of rms alpha-band potential on the scalp. Data was recorded using the 31-Electrode System and spatial power-spectrum estimates (PSEs) were obtained from Mercator projections of the potential interpolated using the triangular method. PSEs were calculated using the Lim and Malik algorithm for maximum-entropy power-spectrum estimation. In order to investigate the utility of spatial power-spectrum analysis, PSEs were obtained from subjects in two conditions; resting with eyes closed (EC) and resting with eyes open and fixed on a single point (EO). A stepwise discriminant analysis was performed with features from the PSEs and the resultant discriminant function was applied to data not considered in the formulation of the function. Over 92{\%} of test data was correctly classified. The features used in the discriminant function identify spatial waves which are most useful in separating data. The results demonstrate that waves oriented along front-back and right-left lines are most important in separating data into EC and EO groups.},

abstract = {Theories about the neural correlates and functional relevance of consciousness have traditionally assigned a crucial role to the prefrontal cortex in generating consciousness as well as in orchestrating high-level conscious control over behavior. However, recent neuroscientific findings show that prefrontal cortex can be activated unconsciously. The depth, direction, and scope of these activations depend on several top-down factors such as the task being probed (task-set, strategy) and on (temporal/spatial) attention. Regardless, such activations-when mediated by feedforward activation only-do not lead to a conscious sensation. Although unconscious, these prefrontal activations are functional, in the sense that they are associated with behavioral effects of cognitive control, such as response inhibition, task switching, conflict monitoring, and error detection. These findings challenge the pivotal role of the prefrontal cortex in consciousness. Instead, it appears that specific brain areas (or cognitive modules) may support specific cognitive functions but that consciousness is independent of this. Conscious sensations arise only when the brain areas involved engage in recurrent interactions enabling the long-lasting exchange of information between brain regions. Moreover, recent evidence suggests that also the state of consciousness, for example, in vegetative state patients or during sleep and anesthesia, is closely related to the scope and extent of residual recurrent interactions among brain regions.},

We evaluate new findings in cognitive neuroscience concerning cortical interactions that subserve the recruitment and implementation of such cognitive control. A review of primate and human studies, along with a meta-analysis of the human functional neuroimaging literature, suggest that the detection of unfavorable outcomes, response errors, response conflict, and decision uncertainty elicits largely overlapping clusters of activation foci in an extensive part of the posterior medial frontal cortex (pMFC). A direct link is delineated between activity in this area and subsequent adjustments in performance. Emerging evidence points to functional interactions between the pMFC and the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC), so that monitoring-related pMFC activity serves as a signal that engages regulatory processes in the LPFC to implement performance adjustments.},

It also has a critical role to play as a tool for the investiga- tions of basic scientific questions of how human subjective experience is related to its biology. Indeed, it got its start as a tool for investigating the relation between EEG activity and its subjective concomitants. Recounted here is an account of how the author's interests in this area led first to the study of dreaming sleep using the EEG, followed by an analysis of the conceptual status of subjective experiences like dreams, introspective reports and physiological indicators. At the same time, in the laboratory the development of operant dis- crimination of brain events became a primary focus, and its results led to the development of EEG biofeedback, now known as neurofeedback, involving both training in the control of the fluctuations in EEG alpha activity, as well as in the control of the central frequency of alpha. The practical applications of neurofeedback in the clinic are not reviewed. Personal contacts with others who learned of my work are described. HISTORY},

abstract = {A possible mechanism underlying the modulatory role of dopamine, adenosine and acetylcholine in the modification of corticostriatal synapses, subsequent changes in signal transduction through the 'direct' and 'indirect' pathways in the basal ganglia and variations in thalamic and neocortical cell activity is proposed. According to this mechanism, simultaneous activation of dopamine D1/D2receptors as well as inactivation of adenosine A1/A2Areceptors or muscarinic M4/M1receptors on striatonigral/striatopallidal inhibitory cells can promote the induction of long-term potentiation/depression in the efficacy of excitatory cortical inputs to these cells. Subsequently augmented inhibition of the activity of inhibitory neurons of the output nuclei of the basal ganglia through the 'direct' pathway together with reduced disinhibition of these nuclei through the 'indirect' pathway synergistically increase thalamic and neocortical cell firing. The proposed mechanism can underlie such well known effects as 'excitatory' and 'inhibitory' influence of dopamine on striatonigral and striatopallidal cells, respectively; the opposite action of dopamine and adenosine on these cells; antiparkinsonic effects of dopamine receptor agonists and adenosine or acetylcholine muscarinic receptor antagonists.

abstract = {In this paper, we show how ElectroEncephaloGraphic (EEG) and MagnetoEncephaloGraphic (MEG) data can be analyzed statistically using nonparametric techniques. Nonparametric statistical tests offer complete freedom to the user with respect to the test statistic by means of which the experimental conditions are compared. This freedom provides a straightforward way to solve the multiple comparisons problem (MCP) and it allows to incorporate biophysically motivated constraints in the test statistic, which may drastically increase the sensitivity of the statistical test. The paper is written for two audiences: (1) empirical neuroscientists looking for the most appropriate data analysis method, and (2) methodologists interested in the theoretical concepts behind nonparametric statistical tests. For the empirical neuroscientist, a large part of the paper is written in a tutorial-like fashion, enabling neuroscientists to construct their own statistical test, maximizing the sensitivity to the expected effect. And for the methodologist, it is explained why the nonparametric test is formally correct. This means that we formulate a null hypothesis (identical probability distribution in the different experimental conditions) and show that the nonparametric test controls the false alarm rate under this null hypothesis. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Rewards are crucial objects that induce learning, approach behavior, choices, and emotions. Whereas emotions are difficult to investigate in animals, the learning function is mediated by neuronal reward prediction error signals which implement basic constructs of reinforcement learning theory. These signals are found in dopamine neurons, which emit a global reward signal to striatum and frontal cortex, and in specific neurons in striatum, amygdala, and frontal cortex projecting to select neuronal populations. The approach and choice functions involve subjective value, which is objectively assessed by behavioral choices eliciting internal, subjective reward preferences. Utility is the formal mathematical characterization of subjective value and a prime decision variable in economic choice theory. It is coded as utility prediction error by phasic dopamine responses. Utility can incorporate various influences, including risk, delay, effort, and social interaction. Appropriate for formal decision mechanisms, rewards are coded as object value, action value, difference value, and chosen value by specific neurons. Although all reward, reinforcement, and decision variables are theoretical constructs, their neuronal signals constitute measurable physical implementations and as such confirm the validity of these concepts. The neuronal reward signals provide guidance for behavior while constraining the free will to act.},

A simple procedure was given there as an FDR controlling procedure for independent test statistics and was shown to be much more powerful than comparable procedures which control the traditional familywise error rate. We prove that this same procedure also controls the false discovery rate when the test statistics have positive regression dependency on each of the test statistics corresponding to the true null hypotheses. This condition for positive dependency is general enough to cover many problems of prac-tical interest, including the comparisons of many treatments with a single control, multivariate normal test statistics with positive correlation matrix and multivariate t. Furthermore, the test statistics may be discrete, and the tested hypotheses composite without posing special difficulties. For all other forms of dependency, a simple conservative modification of the proce-dure controls the false discovery rate. Thus the range of problems for which a procedure with proven FDR control can be offered is greatly increased.},

abstract = {Objectives: Focal electrical fields recorded over the midline prefrontal cortex have been found to index rapid evaluative decisions, including the recognition of having made an error in a speeded response task. The nature of these electrical fields and how they are related to cortical areas involved in response execution remains to be clarified. Methods: As subjects performed a speeded response task the EEG was recorded with a 128-channel sensor array. By filtering out the large slow waves of the event-related potential, we found that the error-related negativity (Ne/ERN) arises from a midline frontal oscillation that alternates with oscillations over lateral sensorimotor cortex. Electrical source analyses were used to determine the brain sources involved in the generation of these oscillations. Results: The results show that the midline and lateral oscillations have a period of about 200 ms (theta), and they are present for both correct and error responses. When an error is made, the midline error oscillation is recruited strongly, and it becomes correlated with the motor oscillation. Source analyses localized the midline error oscillation to centromedial frontal cortex and the lateral oscillation to sensorimotor cortices. Conclusions: Because of the similarity between the midline oscillation observed in the present study and frontal midline theta, the nature of the Ne/ERN may be clarified by the frontal midline theta literature. The correlation between the midline and sensorimotor oscillations suggests a possible mechanism for how midline frontal evaluative and monitoring networks contribute to action regulation. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.},

@incollection{Martinez-Garcia2010,
abstract = {The main aim of this article is to identify the homologues of the different components of the mammalian amygdala in the cerebral hemispheres of non-mammals using, primarily, a topological/embryological perspective. Thus, we first consider two main divisions of the amygdala of mammals, namely the pallial and subpallial (striatopallidal) amygdala. The pallial amygdala includes derivatives of both the lateral and ventral embryonic pallium that in the adult conform layered, superficial areas usually called cortical amygdala, and deep nuclei that conform the basolateral division of the amygdala plus the amygdalohippocampal area (AHA). The components of the subpallial amygdala are usually grouped in two divisions known as central (central amygdala plus parts of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, BST) and medial (medial amygdala plus the posteromedial BST) extended amygdala (EA). We then characterize each of the pallial and subpallial components of the mammalian amygdala using neurochemical and hodological data from the literature. After dissecting out and characterizing the amygdaloid centers of mammals, we use the same criteria (topological/embryological, neurochemical, and hodological) to identify the different components of the reptilian amygdala. This approach reveals that the cortical amygdala of reptiles is composed of the nucleus sphericus and the ventral anterior amygdala, plus maybe portions of the caudal lateral cortex. The reptilian basolateral amygdala includes the posterior dorsal ventricular ridge and the dorsolateral amygdaloid nucleus. In addition, the ventral posterior amygdala seems the reptilian homologue of the mammalian AHA. As in mammals, centers in the subpallial amygdala of reptiles conform a central (striatoamygdaloid transition area and dorsolateral BST) and medial (medial amygdala plus the ventromedial BST) EA. The strong similarities between the avian and reptilian cerebral hemispheres allow us to make a proposal for the identity of the amygdala and its components in the avian telencephalon. This proposal, which nicely fits the embryological/topological, hodological, and neurochemical criteria used to define the divisions of the mammalian amygdala, suggests that the avian amygdala is much larger than previously believed. Whereas in birds the cortical amygdala is reduced to a small rim of olfacto-recipient tissue in the caudal cerebral hemispheres (posterior cortex piriformis plus the surface of the rostral arcopallium), the avian basolateral amygdala consists of the rest of the arcopallium and most of the caudal nidopallium. In addition, the posterior amygdala is the best candidate for the avian homologue of the AHA of mammals. Finally, the nonpallial centers of avian amygdala can also be grouped into a central (SpA and lateral BST) and a medial (nucleus teniae and medial BST) EA. This thorough comparative analysis suggests that the amygdala is an ancient component of the cerebral hemispheres of tetrapods that includes two functional subsystems, namely the central/basolateral and the medial subsystem (which includes the medial EA and the AHA), involved in managing two different, but closely related, functions. The central/basolateral subsystem coordinates innate and learned reactions of fear/anxiety/aversion (through the descending projections of the central EA) or of attraction/reward-directed behaviors (through its projections to the striatum) to virtually any stimulus. The medial subsystem is primarily involved in the coordination of species-specific behavioral responses to chemosensory stimuli (olfactory and vomeronasal) with a strong emotional component, such as reproductive behaviors, defensive/aggressive behaviors to conspecifics (agonistic behaviors), or to predator-derived chemosignals. The deep interconnections of both subsystems explain why reproductive-agonistic behaviors are strongly emotional and might mediate learned emotional responses to many odorants. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {This monograph is an attempt at an explanation of the nature of the process of association in the animal mind. Inasmuch as there have been no extended researches of a character similar to the present one either in subject-matter or experimental method, it is necessary to explain briefly its standpoint. Our knowledge of the mental life of animals equals in the main our knowledge of their sense-powers, of their instincts or reactions performed without experience, and of their reactions which are built up by experience. Confining our attention to the latter we find it the opinion of the better observers and analysts that these reactions can all be explained by the ordinary associative processes without aid from abstract, conceptual, inferential thinking. These associative processes then, as present in animals' minds and as displayed in their acts, are my subject-matter. Anyone familiar in even a general way with the literature of comparative psychology will recall that this part of the field has received faulty and unsuccessful treatment. The careful, minute, and solid knowledge of the sense-organs of animals finds no counterpart in the realm of associations and habits. The main purpose of the study of the animal mind is to learn the development of mental life down through the phylum, to trace in particular the origin of human faculty. In relation to this chief purpose of comparative psychology the associative processes assume a role predominant over that of sense-powers or instinct, for in a study of the associative processes lies the solution of the problem. Sense-powers and instincts have changed by addition and supersedence, but the cognitive side of consciousness has changed not only in quantity but also in quality.
